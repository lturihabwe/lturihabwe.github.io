Javascript Exercises 

1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements? 
setTimeout(booyah, 2000); setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); 
Answer: The first one does not execute the function booyah, it just points to it and it’ll get executed when the time elapses. The second one is a function call to the booyah function and it executes immediately without waiting for the 2 seconds to pass.


2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)? 
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
  return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y);


They both display 6.

3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!” 
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000); setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000); 

function booyah1(){
	alert(“BOOYAH!”);
}
function booyah2(){
	setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
}


4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
