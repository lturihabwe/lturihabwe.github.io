Javascript Scope Exercises 

1.	Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it): 

x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
            var x = 10;
            document.write(x);
            document.write(a);
            var f = function(a, b, c) {
                        b = a;
                        document.write(b); 
                        b = c;
                        var x = 5;
                    }
            f(a,b,c);
            document.write(b);
        }   
c(8,9,10); 
document.write(b);

2. What is the difference between a method and function? 
Answer: A function is a block of code written to perform specific set of tasks. A method is a property of an object that contains a function definition.


3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method? 
Answer: “this” is an implicit parameter used to refer to the current object when used with an instance method or a constructor.


4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method? 
Answer: Outside of a function (in the global context), ‘this’ refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not. 
Inside a function, if the code is not in strict mode and if the value of ‘this’ is not set, it will default to the global object. If it’s in strict mode and the value is not set, it’ll be undefined. 
If used inside an object's method, it refers to itself and it's mandatory unlike in Java.


5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function? 
Answer: Within a class constructor, this is a regular object


6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?

	name: “fred”,
	major: “music”,
	minSquare: function (x,y){
		if ( x === y) {
	        return x**2;
        } else if ( x < y) { 
            return x;
        } else { 
            return y;
        }
    }
}; 

9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function. Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.
